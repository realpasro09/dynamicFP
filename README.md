# Koding Global Virtual Hackathon's Submission Example

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

We are showing the fine prints of legal documents, tos, eula or any other document. By adding custom animations and presentation we are addressing the theme that no ones reads the fine prints of the legal documents. We think that people get bored reading this documents because of lot of text that they donâ€™t understand, and this projects permits the user to select specific sections of the document and add a placeholder of extra information that can help as explanation to the final user. Also, we are hosting any privacy policy for the users, and we enable them to share it view a public link or use an iframe for embedding it to their actual website. Some analytic was added to this so they can track how many views they have got. Also, user may select for now, 4 different layouts so they can build them.
